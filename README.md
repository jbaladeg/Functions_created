# Functions_created
This repository contains proprietary functions that I have created for specific purposes.

functions created up to now:

1. automatic pomp formula

    This function create new variables with a pomp transformation automatically

2. non-normal variable detector

    This function detect non-normal variables in a data frame

3. automatic model writing for the CFA

    Sometimes, we have a lot of varaibles with strange names. If we use exploratory factor analysis (EFA), sometimes the proccess to write the model for the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) could be a hard task, specially when we have to repeate EFA continually. 
   This function writes automatically the optimal model for create our CFA, basing on the EFA results. Each variable is located in the corresponding factor. And we just to copy and paste this console-result to create our model for the CFA. 

4. out-of-range variable detector (coming soon)
5. text-variables calculator (coming soon)
